# Traffic-Light-FSM
Simple VeRTL design of a traffic light FSM with only four possible states, off, red, yellow, and green. The design toggles between red, yellow, and green while it is enabled, and stays off while it is disabled. The traffic light can also be reset at any time by changing the reset pin, which will return the traffic light to the first on state of red
